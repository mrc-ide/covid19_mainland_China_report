<p style="text-align: left; text-indent: 2em;">At noon today, another 10 patients with new coronary pneumonia were cured and discharged from Tianjin. As of noon on February 23, the total number of discharged patients in Tianjin was 75. Since the outbreak of new coronary pneumonia, the cumulative number of discharged patients in Tianjin has exceeded the number of hospitalized patients for the first time.</p> <p style="text-align: center;"><a href="/picture/0/d1c3d23ea61f46c3a6f4e5b4f5216f3b.jpg" target="_blank"><img title="" style="border:none;" src="/picture/0/s_d1c3d23ea61f46c3a6f4e5b4f5216f3b.jpg" width="550" height="201"></a></p> <p style="text-align: left; text-indent: 2em;">Yesterday, a 10-year-old patient has reached discharge standards. However, considering that the child needs mother's care, the medical staff let him stay with his mother. Today, the child's mother was finally determined after inspection and met the discharge standards. The mother and son walked out of the isolation ward together. When he was discharged from the hospital, the child also brought toys and books from the medical staff.</p> <p style="text-align: center;"><a href="/picture/0/dae049a0aa3841bf8d296eb3d18c70e2.jpg" target="_blank"><img title="" style="border:none;" src="/picture/0/s_dae049a0aa3841bf8d296eb3d18c70e2.jpg" width="550" height="206"></a></p> <p style="text-align: left; text-indent: 2em;">According to the child's mother, at present, her husband and daughter are still undergoing treatment. I hope that the two will actively cooperate with the medical staff and reunite as soon as possible.</p> <meta name="ContentEnd">
