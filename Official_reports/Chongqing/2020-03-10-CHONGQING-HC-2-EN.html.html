            <p style="text-indent: 2em; margin-top: 10px;">Today, the Chongqing Municipal Government Information Office held a press conference (forty-fifth session) on the prevention and control of the new crown pneumonia epidemic in Chongqing, and the person in charge of the municipal epidemic prevention and control team notified the city of the epidemic situation.</p>
<p style="text-align: center; text-indent: 0em; margin-top: 20px;"><img title="Picture 1.png" alt="Picture 1.png" src="http://wsjkw.cq.gov.cn/u/cms/www/202003/10195210bkvi.png"></p>
<p style="text-align: center; margin-top: 20px;"><span style="; font-family: Founder Bold_GBK; color: rgb (91,155,213); font-size: 21px"><span style="font-family: Founder Hei_GBK">No new confirmed cases, new cured discharged cases</span>15 cases</span></p>
<p style="text-indent: 2em; margin-top: 20px;">The person in charge of the city's epidemic prevention and control special team reported that there were no new confirmed cases of new coronary pneumonia and 15 new cases of cured discharge from our city from 04:00 to 9 March. As of March 9, there were 28 confirmed cases (including 1 severe case) in the hospital, 6 death cases, 542 cured cases, and 576 confirmed cases. A total of 3528 suspected cases have been ruled out, and 4 cases are still being investigated. A total of 23,677 close contacts have been tracked, 23,558 medical observations have been lifted, and 119 are still receiving medical observations. There were no new confirmed cases in all districts and counties of the city for 14 consecutive days, and the number of existing districts and counties with zero confirmed cases increased to 27. There are 28 confirmed cases in the hospital, all of which are admitted in 4 centralized hospitals.</p>
<p style="text-align: center; margin-top: 20px;"><span style="; font-family: Founder Bold_GBK; color: rgb (91,155,213); font-size: 21px"><span style="font-family: Founder Hei_GBK">Epidemic situation continues to improve</span></span></p>
<p style="text-indent: 2em; margin-top: 20px;">The person in charge of the city's epidemic prevention and control special team introduced that since the outbreak, our city has resolutely implemented the spirit of the important instructions of General Secretary Jinping's internship. In accordance with the decision-making and deployment of the Party Central Committee and the State Council, all levels and departments coordinated operations. Medical workers, community property managers, and quarantine comrades at airports, highways, stations, and other places have worked hard. The general public has given their full support and cooperation. The various measures for epidemic prevention and control have been effectively implemented, and the situation of epidemic prevention and control continues to improve.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 2em; margin-top: 20px;">The person in charge of the Municipal Epidemic Prevention and Control Special Team reported,<strong>First, from the current cumulative number of confirmed cases,</strong>The city is connected with the mountains and rivers of Hubei Province, and has a close relationship with the humanities. It has frequent economic exchanges, intensive personnel exchanges, and a high risk of epidemic input and spread. At present, there are 576 confirmed cases in our city, and the spread of the epidemic has been effectively controlled.<strong>The second is from the daily confirmed case curve analysis,</strong>There are two peaks in Chongqing, on January 30 and February 2, respectively, and the second peak is significantly lower than the first peak. From February 2, the daily confirmed cases continue to decline, reflecting from the other side The effect of early detection and early control in our city.<strong>The third aspect is community non-proliferation.</strong>Of the 576 confirmed cases in our city, 241 were imported cases, and 247 second-generation cases were transmitted by close contact (mainly family and friends) before the imported cases were discovered. The actual cases of local transmission in Chongqing were 88 cases, only Accounted for 15.3%.</p>
<p style="text-align: center; margin-top: 20px; margin-bottom: 5px;"><span style="; font-family: Founder Bold_GBK; color: rgb (91,155,213); font-size: 21px"><span style="font-family: Founder Hei_GBK">Adhere to moving the gate forward, adhere to scientific prevention and control</span></span></p>
<p style="text-indent: 2em; margin-top: 20px;">The person in charge of the city's epidemic prevention and control team emphasized that from the above data, it can be seen that the current prevention and control effects are hard-won.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 2em; margin-top: 20px;"><strong>On the one hand, insist on moving the gate forward and highlight the "four requirements and four ends"</strong></p>
<p style="text-indent: 2em; margin-top: 20px;"><strong>The first is to be exhausted.</strong>Early deployment of community investigations, the No. 1 Document of the Comprehensive Office of the Municipal Epidemic Prevention and Control Leading Group is about community investigations; we have conducted extensive body temperature screening in public places, airports, stations, and communities to achieve full coverage without omissions. As of March 8, four rounds of community-based rolling surveys have been conducted, and a total of 19,517 people have been investigated for suspicious symptoms, and 1,090 have been diagnosed as suspected cases. Fully tracked close contacts, completed more than 8,000 epidemiological case investigations, and tracked a total of 23,677 people. The average number of close contacts tracked per case was far higher than the national average, which effectively controlled potential risks.<strong>The second is to complete the inspection.</strong>We carried out viral nucleic acid testing on all patients, close contacts, and suspected cases. As of March 9, we have tested more than 100,000 people, and we have completely cleared the inventory, and the daily increments are detected. Patients from suspected to confirmed The mean time was shortened from 1.87 days to 0.74 days at the beginning of the epidemic. Early detection of infected persons reduced the risk of transmission.<strong>The third is to manage despite.</strong>From the beginning of the epidemic, quarantine observations have been carried out on migrants in key areas. Centralized isolation management was implemented for close contacts. Since February 8th, the number of close contacts has been significantly reduced from home-based isolation to centralized isolation.<strong>The fourth is to cure everything.</strong>All suspected patients and confirmed patients are treated in designated medical institutions. All patients with asymptomatic infections were also observed in isolation in medical institutions, which increased the rate of consultations.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 2em; margin-top: 20px;"><strong>On the other hand, adhere to scientific prevention and control and highlight the "four key points"</strong></p>
<p style="text-indent: 2em; margin-top: 20px;"><strong>The first is to strengthen prevention and control in key areas.</strong>Implementation of daily thematic research and analysis on key districts and counties, special guidance by experts, and supervision by dedicated personnel to supervise and guide the implementation of prevention and control measures. At present, Wanzhou District has no new confirmed cases for 14 days.<strong>The second is to strengthen prevention and control in key places.</strong>For airports, railway stations, docks, farmers' markets, shopping malls and other densely populated places, strictly implement measures such as environmental sanitation, disinfection, ventilation, "entry and exit inspection", and flow restriction.<strong>The third is to strengthen the prevention and control of key personnel.</strong>Strengthen the management of key groups such as close contacts and asymptomatic infections, and strictly implement isolation measures. Multi-departments coordinated the management of returnees from Chongqing, implemented full-scale health quarantine, and implemented control measures by category.<strong>The fourth is to strengthen the prevention and control of key units.</strong>Strengthen the prevention and control of epidemic situation in special places such as supervision places, pension institutions, welfare homes, mental health medical institutions, etc., and comprehensively implement measures such as detection and inspection, access control, health monitoring, referral and consultation, and strictly prevent import and spread. At present, no related epidemic situation has occurred in relevant institutions in the city.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 2em; margin-top: 20px;">In the next step, we will follow the instructions of General Secretary Xi Jinping: "Strengthening epidemic prevention and control must be done with due care, vigilance against epidemics cannot be reduced, prevention and control requirements cannot be reduced, and we must continue to pay close attention to details." Investigate and judge the situation, internal defense rebound, external defense input, zoning and grading, precise policy, and coordinate overall promotion of epidemic prevention and control and economic and social development.<br></p><!-Accessories-></div>
