            <p style="text-indent: 2em; margin-top: 10px;">Today, the Chongqing Municipal Government Information Office held a press conference on the prevention and control of the new crown pneumonia epidemic in Chongqing (38th session), and the Municipal Health and Health Commission notified the city of the epidemic situation.</p>
<p style="text-align: center; text-indent: 0em; margin-top: 20px;"><img title="Picture 1.png" alt="Picture 1.png" src="http://wsjkw.cq.gov.cn/u/cms/www/202003/03184700s07m.png"></p>
<p style="text-align: center; margin-top: 20px;"><span style="; font-family: Founder Bold_GBK; color: rgb (91,155,213); font-size: 21px"><span style="font-family: Founder Hei_GBK">No new confirmed cases, new cured discharged cases</span>19 cases</span></p>
<p style="text-indent: 2em; margin-top: 20px;">The Municipal Health and Health Committee informed that there were no new confirmed cases of new coronary pneumonia and 19 new cases of cured discharge from our city from 04:00 to 2 March. As of March 2, there were 101 confirmed cases in the city (including 7 severe cases and 2 critical cases), 6 death cases, 469 cured cases, and 576 confirmed cases. A total of 3,519 suspected cases have been ruled out, and 3 suspected cases are still being investigated.

<p style="text-align: center; margin-top: 20px;"><span style="; font-family: Founder Bold_GBK; color: rgb (91,155,213); font-size: 21px"><span style="font-family: Founder Hei_GBK">Epidemic rebound pressure cannot be ignored</span></span></p>
<p style="text-indent: 2em; margin-top: 20px;">The Municipal Health and Health Committee said that experts pointed out that as of March 2, there were no new confirmed cases in our city for 7 consecutive days, and there were no new confirmed cases in 29 districts and counties for 14 consecutive days. The prevention and control situation continues to improve. However, with the resumption of work and production in all units, the mobility of personnel has increased, and the risk of crowd gathering has increased.</p>
<p style="text-align: center; margin-top: 20px;"><span style="; font-family: Founder Bold_GBK; color: rgb (91,155,213); font-size: 21px"><span style="font-family: Founder Hei_GBK">Do your best for medical treatment</span></span></p>
<p style="text-indent: 2em; margin-top: 20px;">According to the Municipal Health and Health Committee, since the outbreak, the city has closely focused on the requirements of “increasing the treatment rate and cure rate, reducing the infection rate and mortality rate”, constantly improving the working mechanism, focusing on advantageous resources, and doing its best in medical treatment.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 2em; margin-top: 20px;">The first is to improve the system so that everything can be cured.<strong>The first is to establish a three-level medical treatment system.</strong>In accordance with the principle of “in line with the city conditions, covering urban and rural areas, sensitive response, and coordinated operation”, 174 hot clinics, 48 district / county designated hospitals, and 4 centralized treatment hospitals were quickly identified, and hot hospitals were screened and suspected cases were designated for hospital isolation The operating system of centralized diagnosis and treatment of diagnosed and confirmed cases, the patient admission rate is 100%.<strong>The second is to establish a three-level expert linkage mechanism.</strong>By concentrating city-level experts, linking district and county experts, and coordinating hospital-level experts, a three-level expert working mechanism at the city, district, county, and hospital level is established to give full play to the technical support role of experts at all levels in medical treatment.<strong>Third, the whole process of medical treatment is standardized.</strong>Formulated standardized technical specifications for the whole process of form management and modular inspection from pre-check and triage, fever diagnosis, isolation screening, case diagnosis, case transfer, centralized treatment, discharge management, and formed the "Chongqing New Crown Pneumonia Medical Treatment Work Guide "to ensure the orderly development of medical treatment work. The fourth is to make a good reserve of medical resources. Formulate the city's "work plan for the preparation and use of medical treatment personnel" and "preparation plan for medical treatment resource reserve", and make medical treatment preparations for the escalation of the epidemic in advance.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 2em; margin-top: 20px;">The second is to move the border forward to strengthen early intervention.<strong>The first is the early identification of suspected cases.</strong>Make overall arrangements for medical treatment and daily diagnosis and treatment of epidemic conditions, improve the in-hospital screening process, standardize the management of pre-screening triage, fever diagnosis, and isolation ward setting, strengthen the screening and identification of ordinary outpatients and ordinary inpatients, and actively prevent cross-infection.<strong>The second is early screening of suspicious cases.</strong>Standardize the setting up of 43 medical institution laboratories and 4 third-party testing institutions, in conjunction with the district and county disease control institutions, to comprehensively carry out screening of new crown virus nucleic acid for fever patients and close contacts, timely detection of positive patients, and prevent the spread of the epidemic.<strong>Third, early guidance from municipal experts.</strong>A 122-person city-level expert group was established, of which the 4 resident expert groups were further divided into the critical group, the ordinary group, and the roving guidance group. The severe group is specifically responsible for the consultation and rescue of severe and critical cases; the general group is responsible for the diagnosis and treatment of ordinary and light cases to prevent the mild to severe cases; the roving guidance group moves to the designated hospitals in each district and county to guide the screening and treatment of suspected cases to prevent The condition worsened. The fourth is early treatment of key links. Standardize the technical operation of key links in rescue diagnosis and treatment, clarify the principle of 72-hour golden rescue, establish an early warning mechanism for critically ill patients, and further improve the cure rate of critically ill patients.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 2em; margin-top: 20px;">Then there are multiple measures to improve the treatment effect.<strong>The first is to strengthen multidisciplinary consultation.</strong>For each patient's specific condition, adhere to the combined treatment of Chinese and Western medicine, equipped with a multi-disciplinary expert team, carry out multi-disciplinary individualized diagnosis and treatment, and formulate the "one person, one strategy" optimal treatment plan.<strong>The second is to strengthen the treatment of critically ill patients.</strong>Implement a 24-hour bedside watch system for frontline medical staff, implement a 24-hour dynamic assessment of the condition, strengthen observation and monitoring of the condition, and adjust the treatment plan in a timely manner. The bedside rounds consultation system for specialists in the critically ill group was implemented to adjust and optimize the treatment plan in a timely manner. Establish a night watch system for multi-disciplinary experts to ensure timely and effective rescue of critically ill patients.<strong>The third is to explore effective means of treatment.</strong>Completed the plasma collection of 7 recovered patients for clinical treatment of critically ill patients. The use of hydroxychloroquine sulfate tablets in the treatment of patients with newly diagnosed coronal pneumonia achieved good results. The Chinese medicine participated in the treatment and achieved significant results. The ECMO and artificial kidney technology were successfully used to save many critical patients. patient. The fourth is to continuously optimize the diagnosis and treatment plan. Experts were organized to study and formulate the "Experts Recommendations for Diagnosis and Treatment of Patients with New Coronary Pneumonia Severe and Critical Patients" and "Experts Recommendations for Nutrition Diagnosis and Treatment for Patients with New Coronary Pneumonia", which will effectively improve the success rate of treatment.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 2em; margin-top: 20px;">As of March 2, a total of 469 patients have been discharged from the hospital, with a discharge rate of 81.4%. The number of severe and critically ill patients has decreased to the current nine, and medical treatment has achieved positive results.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 2em; margin-top: 20px;">The Municipal Health and Health Committee called for the company to resume work and resume production, increase the mobility of personnel, and increase the risk of crowd gathering. The general public is still required to do a good job of self-health management and self-protection so that they do not gather, wear masks, and wash their hands frequently. If you have symptoms such as fever, cough, and fatigue, wear a mask and see a fever clinic in time.</p>
<p style="text-align: center; margin-top: 20px;"><span style="; font-family: Founder Bold_GBK; color: rgb (91,155,213); font-size: 21px"><span style="font-family: Founder Hei_GBK">Actively support Hubei</span></span></p>
<p style="text-indent: 2em; margin-top: 20px;">When answering a reporter's question, the person in charge of the Municipal Health and Health Committee stated that Chongqing takes overall planning into consideration and actively supports Hubei.<strong>The first is to set out as soon as possible.</strong>At present, 18 batches of 1,636 medical staff have been sent to support Wuhan and Xiaogan in Hubei. There are 975 medical staff with intermediate and senior professional titles, of which 188 are doctors with senior professional titles, accounting for 38.13% of the doctors; 1014 are respiratory, severe, and infection professionals, accounting for 64.18% of the medical staff; and the Chongqing medical team participates in severe treatment, accounting for 67.23% .<strong>The second is to strengthen security.</strong>It has allocated 244,400 pieces of medical supplies and 121,400 pieces of living supplies to Chongqing Aid Hubei Medical Team, emergency one ECMO to Xiaogan, Hubei, and ventilator and monitor to Wuhan.<strong>The third is to help the blood.</strong>A total of 523,500 ml of "love blood" was sent to Hubei, and every effort was made to alleviate the pressure of clinical medical treatment in Hubei.<br></p><!-Accessories-></div>
