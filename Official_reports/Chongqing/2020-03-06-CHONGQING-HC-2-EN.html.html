<p style="text-align: center; margin-top: 20px;"><span style="; font-family: Founder Bold_GBK; color: rgb (91,155,213); font-size: 21px"><span style="font-family: Founder Hei_GBK">Continuous dispatch</span>1636 members of 18 medical teams went to Hubei</span></p>
<p style="text-indent: 2em; margin-top: 20px;">The Municipal Health and Health Committee emphasized that General Secretary Xi Jinping pointed out that Hubei and Wuhan are the top priorities for epidemic prevention and control, and the decisive place to win the fight against epidemic prevention and control. Wuhan wins Hubei, Hubei wins national victory. Our city moved by hearing the orders. Health administrative departments and medical institutions at all levels talk about politics and take the overall situation into consideration, overcome difficulties, and take urgent action and deployment. The majority of medical workers have stepped forward to settle their homes and take care of everyone. The decision-making and deployment of the Central Government and the State Council will give the city's strength to fully support Hubei Province in carrying out the prevention and control of new crown pneumonia and medical treatment.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 2em; margin-top: 20px;">According to the introduction of the Municipal Health and Health Committee, in accordance with the requirements of Secretary Chen Min'er, "Hubei needs urgently, do everything Chongqing can do", since January 26, the city has dispatched 18 batches of 1,636 medical teams to Hubei. 6th in the country.

The scale of the support for the Hubei medical team is the largest support operation for the outsourcing of medical personnel in the city's history, involving a total of 13 city-level medical institutions in the city and 89 medical institutions in 37 districts and counties.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 2em; margin-top: 20px;">In supporting Hubei to carry out the treatment of new crown pneumonia, the medical team of our city has effectively implemented the "four mornings", strengthened medical treatment and epidemic situation treatment, and improved the treatment rate and cure rate. In accordance with the "four concentration" principle, we have made great efforts to provide medical treatment for severely ill patients. Strengthening nosocomial infection control, further reducing the case fatality rate and infection rate, making a "Chongqing contribution" to defending the people's health in Hubei and decisively fighting the epidemic, and using actual actions to practice "respect life, save lives, be dedicated, and love big" "Professionalism. As of 24:00 on March 4, the Hubei Medical Team was responsible for 4,346 beds, accumulatively managing 4,152 patients, including 390 critically ill patients, 95 critically ill patients, a total of 1,616 discharged patients, and a total of 3,334 nursing patients.

<p style="text-align: center; margin-top: 20px;"><span style="; font-family: Founder Bold_GBK; color: rgb (91,155,213); font-size: 21px"><span style="font-family: Founder Hei_GBK">Continue to maintain first-level response</span></span></p>
<p style="text-indent: 2em; margin-top: 20px;">The person in charge of the Municipal Health and Health Committee said in response to a reporter's question that since late February, more than a dozen provinces and cities across the country have successively adjusted the response level to public health emergencies, and some citizens are more concerned about how the city will adjust. In fact, the city's epidemic prevention and control work is always based on the overall epidemic situation and the central requirements, Chongqing's actual situation, to carry out timely research and judgment, dynamic adjustment. At present, the city continues to maintain a first-level response on the basis of organizing relevant experts to conduct a comprehensive and comprehensive evaluation of the epidemic situation. This is mainly based on the following considerations.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 2em; margin-top: 20px;">The first is to continue to maintain a high degree of vigilance against the epidemic. General Secretary Xi Jinping emphasized that in order to clearly understand the complexity of the current epidemic prevention and control and the economic and social development situation, strengthening the epidemic prevention and control must be prudent, the vigilance against the epidemic cannot be reduced, and the requirements for prevention and control cannot be reduced. Combining with the actual situation of our city, we will continue to maintain a first-level response at this time, which will help the city's epidemic prevention and control work continue to be carried out.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 2em; margin-top: 20px;">Second, the city's external defense input tasks are still heavy. The central government pointed out that the epidemic prevention and control tasks in Hubei and Wuhan are still arduous and arduous. It is necessary to continue to maintain the prevention and control strategies of internal proliferation prevention and external prevention output, and strictly control the Lihan and Lihe channels. 53 towns in 9 districts and counties of our city are bordered by Hubei Province. The mountains and rivers are connected, the humanities are intimate with each other, and the economic exchanges are frequent. It is necessary to continue to do a good job of preventing and controlling the epidemic from being imported into our city. At the same time, the epidemic situation in some countries and regions has been severe recently. The city is more open to the outside world and there is also greater pressure to prevent overseas imports. Therefore, maintaining a first-level response is conducive to continuing to do a good job in preventing and controlling epidemic import at home and abroad.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 2em; margin-top: 20px;">Third, the task of non-proliferation in the city cannot be relaxed. With the resumption of work and production in industrial enterprises and business service enterprises, government agencies and institutions go to work, business activities increase, and the risk of spreading the epidemic caused by personnel mobility increases. Continue to maintain a first-level response, which is conducive to strengthening the management and control of people who come to Chongqing from key areas, do a good job of health monitoring and service management of overseas people who enter Chongqing, and do a good job of dynamic management and community management of reworkers and returnees.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 2em; margin-top: 20px;">At the same time, in accordance with the central government's decision-making and deployment on “outlining priorities, taking overall planning into consideration, classified guidance, and partitioned strategies,” according to the guidance of the State Council ’s joint prevention and control mechanism, the city will implement hierarchical classification prevention and control from February 19, with districts and counties as the The units are divided into low-risk, medium-risk, and high-risk districts and counties, and differentiated prevention and control is implemented. During the implementation process, the city's epidemic prevention and control headquarters made dynamic adjustments to the list of risky districts and counties on the basis of scientific research and judgment.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 2em; margin-top: 20px;">The Central Leadership Group response to the epidemic situation requires that other regions of the country except Hubei should adjust the emergency response level according to the actual situation, combine with the county's differentiated prevention and control, accurately implement various prevention and control measures after resumption and production, and reduce unnecessary crowds. Orderly restore normal order of production and life. At present, the situation of epidemic prevention and control in our city continues to improve, and efforts are being made to promote the resumption of production and production of enterprises to normal production and operation, and the recovery of production and living order is accelerating. In the next step, the municipal epidemic prevention and control headquarters will obey the overall situation of national epidemic prevention and control, and according to the actual situation in Chongqing, scientifically judge and adjust the public health emergency response level in a timely manner.<br></p><!-Accessories-></div>
