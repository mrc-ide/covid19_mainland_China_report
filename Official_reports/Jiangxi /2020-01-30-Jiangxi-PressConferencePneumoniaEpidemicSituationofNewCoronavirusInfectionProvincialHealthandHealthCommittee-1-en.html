The director of the Provincial Party Committee Leading Group Office for Pneumonia Epidemic Situation of New Coronavirus Infection and the Secretary of the Party Group of the Provincial Health and Health Committee 2. Director Wang Xingwei briefed the province on the latest situation of the epidemic situation, introduced the progress of epidemic prevention and control in our province, and answered questions from reporters. The full text is published as follows:</span> </p><p> Ladies and gentlemen, </p><p> Dear news media friends, </p><p> happy New Year everyone! </p><p> Everyone is welcome to participate in today&#39;s press conference. I sincerely thank all journalists and friends for their great attention and support for the prevention and control of pneumonia caused by new coronavirus infection in Jiangxi. Below, I will give a brief report on the pneumonia epidemic situation and prevention and control of new coronavirus infection in the province. </p><p style="text-align: center;"> <a href="/uploadfiles/202001/30/2020013015423852149611.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="/uploadfiles/202001/30/2020013017090198222597-thumbnail.jpg"></a> </p><p> <strong>I. The latest situation of the epidemic situation in the province</strong> </p><p> At present, the pneumonia epidemic situation of new coronavirus infection in our province is severe and the task is arduous. As of 24:00 on January 28, 2020, the province has reported a total of 109 confirmed cases of pneumonia (including 11 cases of severe cases) of new coronavirus infection. Among them, there were 25 cases in Nanchang, 16 in Jiujiang, 16 in Ganzhou, 14 in Yichun, 11 in Xinyu, 9 in Shangrao, 9 in Fuzhou, 4 in Ji&#39;an, 2 in Pingxiang, and 2 in Jingdezhen. Case, one case in Yingtan City. At the same time, according to the epidemic prevention and control requirements, we have traced 3850 close contacts, 123 medical observations have been lifted, and 3727 people are still receiving medical observations. Fortunately, after the full treatment of medical staff, as of now, 3 cases in our province have been cured and discharged. </p><p> <strong>Second, the province&#39;s major epidemic prevention and control work</strong> </p><p> Since the outbreak of pneumonia caused by a new type of coronavirus infection in Wuhan, General Secretary Xi Jinping has always attached great importance to holding meetings and giving important instructions, which fully reflects the great love that is highly responsible for the safety and health of the people. The various prevention and control work pointed out the way forward and provided fundamental compliance. The Jiangxi Provincial Party Committee and Provincial Government resolutely implement the spirit of the important instructions of General Secretary Jinping, implement the important instructions of Premier Li Keqiang and the decision-making arrangements of the Party Central Committee and the State Council, and effectively take effective prevention and control of the epidemic as the &quot;four consciousness&quot; and firm &quot;four self-confidence &quot;, To achieve the&quot; two maintenance &quot;of the actual inspection and actual action, with a highly responsible attitude to the party and the people to go all out to do a good job of epidemic prevention and control. </p><p> First, speed up prevention and control work. On January 16th, our province established a new coronavirus-infected pneumonia epidemic prevention and emergency command headquarters, and established a joint epidemic prevention and control mechanism to coordinate and command the joint prevention and control of the entire province. On January 24, the provincial party committee and government initiated the first-level response to major public health emergencies in the province. Our province was one of the first provinces in the country to initiate a first-level response. On January 26, the enlarged meeting of the Standing Committee of the Provincial Committee decided to establish The Provincial Party Committee and the Provincial Government are mainly responsible for the leadership of the epidemic response work of the Provincial Party Committee headed by comrades, and comprehensively strengthen the unified leadership of the epidemic prevention and control work. After the first-level response to major public health emergencies in the province, Liu Qi, the secretary of the provincial party committee, and Yi Lianhong, the governor of the province, have been on the frontline of epidemic prevention and control, dispatching and directing epidemic prevention and control, and coordinating and solving major issues of epidemic prevention and control. Through in-depth field investigations and inspections of medical institutions, material production enterprises, urban and rural communities, and farmers&#39; markets, the province&#39;s epidemic prevention and control work is progressing in a scientific and orderly manner. On the evening of January 25, the epidemic prevention and control emergency command comprehensively judged the situation of the epidemic situation in the province, and issued six emergency command orders successively to investigate and monitor, isolate people, traffic control, grid management, group prevention and control, and regulate fever patients. Make specific arrangements for consultation. Party committees and governments at all levels and grassroots cadres are fighting on the front line of the epidemic prevention and control. The broad masses of the people actively support and participate in the formation of the province. Tight lines of defense, a situation of mobilization of the whole people, participation of the whole people, and time to cope with the difficulties have taken shape. In particular, the vast number of medical workers fighting on the front lines of the epidemic have demonstrated their superb professionalism and noble moral sentiments. They have come forward at the critical moment of the epidemic, and gave up their lives for everyone, helping the wounded and risking being infected. Risks go to great lengths to treat patients. Where there is danger, there are party members and cadres, and there are medical workers. They are indeed &quot;angels in white&quot;, they are heroes of the new era, they are the cutest people in the new era, and they are role models for all of us. </p><p> Second, comprehensive inspection and screening of epidemic situation. In an effort to curb the spread of the epidemic, our province has issued public letters, &quot;six-must&quot; announcements, and set up hotlines to improve the people&#39;s awareness of epidemic prevention and control and reduce the risk of transmission. At the same time, the whole province has carried out comprehensive registration of repatriation and returnees from all over the province, establishing daily tracking management accounts for returnees from Wuhan; setting up inspection stations at all borders outside the province, as well as airports, train stations, and bus stations. In key places such as hospitals and wharfs, temperature monitoring and screening will be fully implemented. Examination, registration, and disposal of people with fever will be implemented. Daily reporting and zero reporting systems will be implemented to enable early detection, early reporting, early isolation, and early treatment. We are also glad to see that people&#39;s awareness of self-protection is constantly increasing, and small rural speakers and emergency broadcasts have spontaneously played a role. Up to now, the province has screened 138,200 people from Hubei, including 99,000 people from Wuhan. Fever patients have been transferred to designated hospitals for isolation and treatment. </p><p> Third, medical treatment is organized scientifically. Developed a temperature monitoring flowchart, a fever information registration form, and a case confirmation process to provide technical support for the scientific treatment of epidemics in various places. Forty-nine experts were carefully selected to form a provincial medical treatment expert group to strengthen technical guidance for the prevention and control of epidemic situation in each city and county. There are 105 designated hospitals for medical treatment at the provincial, city and county levels, and 318 outpatient clinics. When confirmed cases or suspected cases are found, the &quot;four concentration&quot; principle of centralized cases, centralized experts, centralized resources, and centralized treatment shall be implemented, and timely and scientific efficient treatment. For severe cases, in accordance with the &quot;one person, one plan&quot; and &quot;one person, one team&quot; principle, arrange for treatment at the district or city level hospitals with the strongest comprehensive strength and protective conditions for respiratory infectious diseases; in principle, for critical cases, focus on Provincial designated medical institutions provide treatment to ensure that patients are treated free of charge. For example, we will use the new hospital area of the First Affiliated Hospital of Nanchang University (Xianghu Hospital) in the province as the designated hospital for critically ill patients, and rapidly expand to 500 beds based on the existing 200 beds. To ensure adequate treatment capacity. On January 27, two confirmed cases were successfully discharged from our province (currently there are only 12 cases in the country). The epidemic prevention and control emergency command specially praised this. On January 28, the third confirmed case in our province was successfully cured and discharged. </p><p> Fourth, compact the responsibility for prevention and control. Departments of health, development and reform, industrial credit, commerce, market supervision, public security, transportation, drug supervision and other departments actively organize the production, transportation, and storage of emergency supplies such as medicines, medical equipment, and protective supplies, with emphasis on masks , Protective clothing, infrared temperature monitor, emergency rescue medicines and other scarce supplies. Relevant departments take the initiative to act, resolutely prohibit hunting, eating and trading of wild animals, resolutely crack down on illegal activities such as hoarding and raising prices, and do their best to ensure supply and stabilize prices, and effectively maintain market order. Various regions have also actively carried out patriotic health campaigns in winter and spring, strengthened supervision and management of farmer markets, “five small” industries, old neighborhoods, back streets and alleys, and made every effort to curb the spread of the epidemic. </p><p> Fifth, actively respond to public concerns. Strengthen public opinion monitoring and public opinion guidance, and regularly update the situation of pneumonia public opinion surveillance of new coronavirus infections daily; through WeChat, Weibo, video (audio), mobile newspapers, printed promotional leaflets, etc., publish scientific knowledge and timely release me Provincial epidemic prevention and control work progressed, and the people&#39;s concern was actively responded to. Increase science popularization and public opinion control. TV stations and other media will roll out the epidemic prevention and control information and health tips 24 hours a day, guide the public to understand the epidemic scientifically and rationally, increase protection awareness, eliminate panic psychology, and understand and support the prevention and control work. For this reason, the old man in the red earth holy land of Jiangxi also clearly put forward &quot;three humane care should be in place&quot;, that is: humane care for medical staff must be in place, humane care for infected patients must be in place, and Humane care must be in place. At the same time, we have also seriously investigated and dealt with illegal acts such as spreading rumors, taking advantage of speculation, inciting trouble, and effectively maintaining normal social order. </p><p> <strong>Third, the next work arrangement</strong> </p><p> We will thoroughly implement the spirit of General Secretary Xi Jinping ’s important instructions, comprehensively implement the decision-making and deployment of the Party Central Committee and the State Council, effectively strengthen the sense of political responsibility and urgency, resolutely defend the bottom line of public health security, resolutely prevent the spread of the epidemic, and resolutely safeguard the health of the people and social security The big picture. Focus on four areas of work: </p><p> The first is to further strengthen the joint defense and joint control, group defense and group control, and group defense and group governance mechanisms to resolutely block the source of virus infection. Strengthen coordination and cooperation among regions and departments, and eliminate all unnecessary personnel gathering activities. Widely mobilize the masses, fully believe in the masses, and rely on the masses to take the most stringent and comprehensive measures to thoroughly investigate returnees from the province to Jiangxi, further strengthen the inspection and monitoring of urban communities and rural areas, and urge cities and counties to establish isolation Make points and keep opinions, make medical observations of close contacts, make every effort to cut off the source of infection, and keep to the bottom line that the epidemic is not contagious and non-proliferation. </p><p> The second is to further strengthen material security. On the one hand, it actively organizes and coordinates the resumption of production of pharmaceutical companies in the province, on the other hand, it actively purchases from the national market and seeks emergency support from the state for material support. It has exhausted measures to protect the needs of prevention and control materials and the needs of medical personnel to protect materials. Strengthen the supply of daily necessities and other materials, and effectively safeguard and guarantee the normal order of production and life of the people. </p><p> The third is to further strengthen medical treatment. Improve and optimize emergency plans and work plans for prevention, control and rescue. Centrally treat fever patients to ensure timely treatment of critically ill patients. Set up provincial medical rescue commandos to strengthen the ability to deal with emergencies. </p><p> The fourth is to further strengthen discipline supervision. In order to ensure the comprehensive implementation of the various preventive and control measures of the Provincial Party Committee and the Provincial Government, the Provincial Commission for Discipline Inspection and the Provincial Supervisory Committee specially set up supervision teams to urge and inspect the various places. Allegations of ineffective work and serious accountability in accordance with laws and regulations. </p><p> Dear friends of the news media, the prevention and control of pneumonia epidemic of the new coronavirus infection has entered the decisive stage. Under the strong leadership of the Party Central Committee with Comrade Xi Jinping as the core, we will go all out to consolidate responsibilities, strengthen measures, and make up for shortcomings. , Resolutely win and fight this epidemic prevention and control fight! I hope that all media reporter friends will give us suggestions and suggestions. </p><p> thank you all. </p><p></p><p> <strong>Reporter&#39;s question:</strong> We are glad to see that there have been 3 cases of patients discharged from our province. This is a great encouragement to the epidemic prevention and control work and the people. Could you please tell us about the situation? </p><p style="text-align: center;"> <a href="/uploadfiles/202001/30/2020013017091446690667.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="/uploadfiles/202001/30/2020013017091446690667-thumbnail.jpg"></a> </p><p> <strong>A reporter asked:</strong> It is indeed good news. First of all, I would like to thank this reporter friend of Xinhua News Agency for her concern and concern over the medical treatment of the epidemic! </p><p> Fully treating and maintaining the health of infected patients is one of the key links in epidemic prevention and control, and it is also the focus of great attention. In the early days of epidemic prevention and control, we focused on prevention and control. When the first case appeared in our province, we immediately put the patients under treatment in an important position. During the critical period of the province&#39;s epidemic prevention and control, on January 27 and 28, three patients with neonatal pneumonia in our province were cured and discharged one after another. This is the most gratifying, exciting and encouraging news in the province, and it is the epidemic prevention in our province. An important step in turning the situation in control work has a weathervane significance for successfully fighting the epidemic prevention and control fight. I think it has at least three aspects. </p><p> First, strengthened confidence. After the outbreak, the Provincial Committee of Health and Health set up an expert group, identified hospitals, grasped material reserves, strengthened consultation guidance, and strengthened case treatment. The three patients with new coronary pneumonia were cured and discharged, which fully demonstrates that Jiangxi&#39;s epidemic prevention and control work is orderly and effective, and also shows that our province has a high capacity for medical treatment of new coronary pneumonia, which has made us more determined to &quot;concentrate patients and experts The principle of &quot;focusing resources, centralizing treatment&quot; is to strengthen the management of designated hospitals, and to give full play to the role of expert technical support and guidance. </p><p> Second, it boosted morale. At present, the situation of epidemic prevention and control is complicated and severe, and it now covers 11 districts and cities. In addition, the epidemic occurred during the Spring Festival and frequent staff movements, and the epidemic prevention and control work is under great pressure. The three patients with new crown pneumonia were cured and discharged, injecting a booster into the current epidemic prevention and control work. We firmly believe that the people of the whole province can also rest assured that under the strong leadership of the Party Central Committee and the State Council and the correct leadership of the Provincial Party Committee and Provincial Government, with all the people in the whole province as one aspirations, the city will surely control the epidemic and defeat the epidemic. </p><p> Third, the path is clear. &quot;Early detection, early reporting, early diagnosis, early isolation, and early treatment&quot; are important strategies to effectively respond to the epidemic. Three patients with neonatal pneumonia who were cured and discharged were analyzed. It took about one week from the diagnosis to the cure. This fully shows that the sooner the patient finds out, the shorter the duration of the disease, and the better the treatment effect. For this reason, we sincerely hope that, for the health of everyone, everyone must actively cooperate with the provincial epidemic prevention and control headquarters and the local party committee and government to deploy, actively participate in the investigation, and actively accept the investigation. Once there are signs of fever, actively observe and treat. Ensure the most appropriate disposal in the shortest possible time. This is also the key to defeating the epidemic. Although we have cured 3 cases, the current situation is still very grim. There is still much work to do to strengthen epidemic prevention and control and medical treatment. In the next step, we will continue to implement the “Five Mornings” prevention and control strategy, strengthen joint prevention and control, group prevention and group control, and group prevention and group management, and further strengthen community prevention and control management, traffic temperature detection, hospital pre-inspection, Case diagnosis and treatment, popularization of scientific knowledge, and all-out efforts to implement various epidemic prevention and control measures to win the people&#39;s war against gunpowder-free epidemic prevention and control. </p><!--<$[CONTENT]>end--></div><script type="text/javascript">
